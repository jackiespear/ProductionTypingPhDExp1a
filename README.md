# jsPsychProductionTypingPhDExp1
Experiment 1 of my PhD Thesis. Production by typing using words from Johns and Swanson (1988)

This experiment is a standard yes/no recognition memory test.
During the study phase, participants will be presented with word pairs and instructed to produce the green words but only read the red words.

Both pure and mixed lists will be used

Each participant will be presented with a total of 40 word pairs during the study phase.

Participants will then be tested for their recognition of the second word in each pair, one at a time, along with an equal amount of new, unstudied lures (80 words in total).

A practice phase with typing feedback has been added.

Demographic questions, including a distraction question, have been added to the end of the experiment.
